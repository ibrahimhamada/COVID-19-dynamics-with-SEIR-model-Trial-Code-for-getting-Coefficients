# Stochastic-Processes-Calculator

My Project of the Probability and Stochastic Processes Course Offered in Fall 2020 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I created a MATLAB GUI-based tool that allows a user to enter any stochastic process and results its
ensemble and time statistics of such process. 

Moreover, the implmented GUI was used to plot the ACF and the PSD of the following binary stochastic processes:
1) Polar NRZ process
2) Unipolar NRZ process
3) Manchester process
